> Take Picture.Upload.Sell. Its that easy. Many models and photographers offer to sell pictures and videos on personal sites, but their are none that are auction based. This will bring the professionals and the amateurs to the same place, side by side to collect their profits.
> The risk seems to be the initial investment to get this off the ground. I will invest the time, and money that I do have. This is my only project, Lets do it!

### The project

The primary pitch for this project is <b>"Upload images and short videos to sell to other users on an auction based website directly from their mobile device."</b>.

I have accounts on multiple stock image services (Getty Images, sxc.hu, Shutterstock, iStockPhoto) for web development use. Having to wait for auctions to end is not going to go over well when someone is on the hunt for a stock image - timed auctions on pre-existing media assets is simply not something that most people can tolerate, with deadlines and specific budgets. Based on the badly-censored project picture and the project title of "Sell Yourself", it appears to imply some adult themes here. As the creator is from the States, they may be subject to verifying age and complying with 18 USÂ§2257 for people uploading adult images of themselves and may be subject to large amounts of risk, as very few hosting providers want to go anywhere near self-cam galleries.

<b>However</b>, this could possibly be viable with some changes. For example, a premium video or picture on demand platform. An advertising company or startup wants "white female scrolling through their site on an iPhone 6", so they could put up a request for that on SellYourself, with a $x 'reward' that grants them exclusive licence to it with SellYourself taking a percent commission for connecting the two parties together, payment processing gateway costs, etc.
Basically, images and videos that are too specific to be found on a stock image site.

### Other comments

The creator of this campaign does not have a website or any useful information whatsoever regarding their previous experience in their profile. This is their first project and only project.
