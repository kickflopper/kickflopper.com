> Tech Czar would like to build a free small data center where anyone who wants to start a business or website can without any cost.
> The data center we are opening will be open to anyone anywhere in the world free of cost to generate new ideas and businesses in the online world. Help create a datacenter where volunteers maintain this free data center.

### The project

Funny enough, this has actually been done before -- though not for free. There's something in the states and I've seen in Netherlands called "community colocation" where members can purchase datacentre space at-cost,
with sliding scale fees based on how much they can afford and how much hardware they need.

<b>For $100, you get "Free Unlimited Dedicated Server Space and Email"</b>. This is not physically possible, not financially possible, and in general a completely ridiculous concept. Unlimited hosting does not exist.
Unlimited bandwidth does not exist. There is a large difference between the term unlimited and unmetered -- one meaning infinite and one meaning we won't count how much you're using. While bandwidth can be unmetered,
physical space, drive space, and others are all subject to physical limitations and can't simply be unaccounted for.

Nothing is free. Datacentres are expensive to run, require continuous cooling, power, and bandwidth. An even larger problem here presents itself with the campaign rewards, as they very clearly
represent the creator as being clueless in regard to hosting: offering two tiers - "Free Server Space and Email" and "Free Unlimited Dedicated Server Space and Email". There is nothing about rack units, there is nothing
about who is going to be leasing those dedicated machines for the $100 tier. Even Google, building the largest, most dense datacentres from the ground up does not offer "unlimited email".

> Help create a datacenter where volunteers maintain this free data center.

Transit and peering providers will not volunteer anything.

The goal of $90,000 will not purchase even a single floor of a datacentre, much less a complete fully-owned datacentre. On top of that, transit, power, cooling costs are recurring monthly charges. A one time cash infusion
is not going to accomplish anything, and will just result in creditors seizing any available hardware to auction off.

### Other comments

The creator of this campaign has a website listed in their profile. It doesn't appear to be a computer repair shop or IT-business, but instead a <b>free web shopping cart software, hosted on free hosting (X10Hosting), without SSL/TLS (HTTPS)</b>. It looks like it mostly sells presumably-dropshipped overpriced consumer equipment like last-generation Linksys routers.

The rewards have an estimated delivery date of Nov 2015. Getting transit contracts signed or even building/construction permits or rezoning is going to take longer than a few months.
