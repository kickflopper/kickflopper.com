> Tech Czar would like to build a free small data center where anyone who wants to start a business or website can without any cost.
> The data center we are opening will be open to anyone anywhere in the world free of cost to generate new ideas and businesses in the online world. Help create a datacenter where volunteers maintain this free data center.

### The project

Funny enough, this has actually been done before -- though not for free. There's something in the states and I've seen in Netherlands called "community colocation" where members can purchase datacentre space at-cost,
with sliding scale fees based on how much they can afford and how much hardware they need.

Nothing is free. Datacentres are expensive to run, require continuous cooling, power, and bandwidth. An even larger problem here presents itself with the campaign rewards, as they very clearly
represent the creator as being clueless.

<b>For $100, you get "Free Unlimited Dedicated Server Space and Email"</b>. This is not physically possible, not financially possible, and in general a completely ridiculous concept. Unlimited hosting does not exist.
Unlimited bandwidth does not exist. There is a large difference between the term unlimited and unmetered -- one meaning infinite and one meaning we won't count how much you're using. While bandwidth can be unmetered,
physical space, drive space, and others are all subject to physical limitations and can't simply be unaccounted for.

The goal of $90,000 will not purchase even a single floor of a datacentre, much less a complete fully-owned datacentre.

### Other comments

The creator of this campaign has a website listed in their profile. It doesn't appear to be a computer repair shop or IT-business, but instead a <b>free web shopping cart software, hosted on free hosting (X10Hosting), without SSL/TLS
(HTTPS)</b>. It looks like it mostly sells presumably-dropshipped overpriced consumer equipment like last-generation Linksys routers.
